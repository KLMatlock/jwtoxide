Building Documentation

Documentation is built using Sphinx and hosted on Read the Docs.

For building the documentation, you will need a Python environment >=3.12. First install the documentation dependencies:

::
    $ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

Then build the documentation:

::
    $ make docs
